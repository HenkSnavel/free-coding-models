# Changelog

---

## 0.1.23 — 2026-02-22

### Refactored
- **Removed startup menu**: No more blocking mode selection menu at startup
- **Default to OpenCode CLI**: App starts directly in CLI mode when no flags given
- **Mode toggle in TUI**: Added Z key to cycle between CLI → Desktop → OpenClaw → CLI
- **GitHub changelogs**: "Read Changelogs" option now opens GitHub URL instead of local file
- **Auto-update by default**: When new version available without flags, auto-updates and relaunches
- **Centered update menu**: Update notification appears only when needed, with clean centered layout

### Changed
- **Header display**: Shows `[💻 CLI] (Z to toggle)` with mode toggle hint
- **Footer instructions**: Added "M Mode" to key bindings
- **Update workflow**: Flags (`--opencode` etc.) still show update menu for compatibility

---

## 0.1.22 — 2026-02-22

### Changed
- **Local changelogs**: "Read Changelogs" menu option now opens local `CHANGELOG.md` file instead of GitHub releases

---

## 0.1.21 — 2026-02-22

### Refactored
- **Simplified tier filtering architecture**: Replaced complex object recreation with simple `hidden` flag system
- **Flags as shortcuts**: `--tier S` now just sets initial state instead of blocking dynamic filtering
- **Dynamic filtering preserved**: E/D keys work seamlessly even when starting with `--tier` flag

### Fixed
- **Ping loop bug**: Fixed issue where filtered models weren't pinged due to using wrong results array
- **Initial ping bug**: Fixed issue where initial ping used wrong results array

---

## 0.1.20 — 2026-02-22

### Added
- **Dynamic tier filtering**: Use E/D keys to filter models by tier during runtime
- Tier filter badge shown in header (e.g., `[Tier S]`)
- E key elevates filter (show fewer, higher-tier models)
- D key descends filter (show more, lower-tier models)
- Preserves ping history when changing filters

### Fixed
- **Error 401 with --tier flag**: Fixed issue where using `--tier` alone would show selection menu instead of proceeding directly to TUI
- Improved flag combination handling for better user experience

---

## 0.1.16

### Added
- OpenCode Desktop support: new `--opencode-desktop` flag and menu option to set model & open the Desktop app
- "Read Changelogs" menu option when an update is available (opens GitHub releases page)
- `startOpenCodeDesktop()` function — same config logic as CLI, launches via `open -a OpenCode`

### Changed
- Startup menu: "OpenCode" renamed to "OpenCode CLI", new "OpenCode Desktop" entry added
- TUI mode badge: shows `[💻 CLI]` or `[🖥 Desktop]` or `[🦞 OpenClaw]`
- Footer action hint adapts to desktop mode (`Enter→OpenDesktop`)

---

## 0.1.12 — 2026-02-22

### Added
- Unit test suite: 59 tests across 11 suites using `node:test` (zero dependencies)
- Tests cover: sources data integrity, core logic (getAvg, getVerdict, getUptime, filterByTier, sortResults, findBestModel), CLI arg parsing, package.json sanity
- `lib/utils.js`: extracted pure logic functions from the monolithic CLI for testability
- `pnpm test` script in package.json

### Fixed
- GitHub Actions release workflow: removed broken `npm version patch` loop, added version detection via git tags
- GitHub Actions now creates a GitHub Release with auto-generated notes for each new version

### Changed
- AGENTS.md updated with test-first workflow: agents must run `pnpm test` before `pnpm start`

---

## 0.1.9 — 2026-02-22

### Fixed
- **OpenCode spawn ENOENT**: Use `shell: true` when spawning `opencode` so the command resolves correctly on Windows (`.cmd`/`.bat` wrappers). Added friendly error message when `opencode` is not installed.
### Added
- Update available warning: red message shown above selection menu when a new npm version exists
- "Update now" menu choice in startup mode selection to install the latest version

---

## 0.1.4 — 2026-02-22

### Fixed
- **OpenClaw config structure**: `providers` was incorrectly written at the config root. Moved to `models.providers` per official OpenClaw docs (`docs.openclaw.ai/providers/nvidia`).
- **OpenClaw API key storage**: Removed `apiKey` from provider block (not a recognized field). API key is now stored under `env.NVIDIA_API_KEY` in the config.
- **OpenClaw models array**: Removed the `models: []` array from the provider block (OpenCode format, not valid in OpenClaw).
- **`openclaw restart` CLI command doesn't exist**: Replaced hint with correct commands — `openclaw models set` / `openclaw configure`. Gateway auto-reloads on config file changes.
- **OpenClaw model not allowed**: Model must be explicitly listed in `agents.defaults.models` allowlist — without this, OpenClaw rejects the model with "not allowed" even when set as primary.
- **README**: Updated OpenClaw integration section with correct JSON structure and correct CLI commands.

## 0.1.3 — 2026-02-22

### Added
- OpenClaw integration: set selected NIM model as default provider in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`
- Startup mode menu (no flags needed): interactive choice between OpenCode and OpenClaw at launch
- `--openclaw` flag: skip menu, go straight to OpenClaw mode
- `--tier` flag: filter models by tier letter (S, A, B, C)
- Tier badges shown next to model names in the TUI
- 44 models listed, ranked by Aider Polyglot benchmark

### Fixed
- CI permissions for git push in release workflow

---

## 0.1.2 — 2026-02-22

### Added
- `--fiable` flag: analyze 10 seconds, output the single most reliable model as `provider/model_id`
- `--best` flag: show only top-tier models (A+, S, S+)
- `--opencode` flag: explicit OpenCode mode
- Refactored CLI entry point, cleaner flag handling
- Updated release workflow

---

## 0.1.1 — 2026-02-21

### Added
- Continuous monitoring mode: re-pings all models every 2 seconds forever
- Rolling averages calculated from all successful pings since start

- OpenCode integration: auto-detects NIM setup, sets model as default, launches OpenCode
- `sources.js`: extensible architecture for adding new providers
- Demo GIF added to README
- Renamed CLI to `free-coding-models`

---
