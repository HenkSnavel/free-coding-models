# Agent Instructions

## Post-Feature Testing

After completing any feature or fix, the agent MUST:

1. Run `pnpm test` to verify all unit tests pass (59 tests across 11 suites)
2. If any test fails, fix the issue immediately
3. Re-run `pnpm test` until all tests pass
4. Run `pnpm start` to verify there are no runtime errors
5. If there are errors, fix them immediately
6. Re-run `pnpm start` until all errors are resolved
7. Only then consider the task complete

This ensures the codebase remains in a working state at all times.

## Test Architecture

- Tests live in `test/test.js` using Node.js built-in `node:test` + `node:assert` (zero deps)
- Pure logic functions are in `lib/utils.js` (extracted from the main CLI for testability)
- The main CLI (`bin/free-coding-models.js`) imports from `lib/utils.js`
- If you add new pure logic (calculations, parsing, filtering), add it to `lib/utils.js` and write tests
- If you modify existing logic in `lib/utils.js`, update the corresponding tests

### What's tested:
- **sources.js data integrity** — model structure, valid tiers, no duplicates, count consistency
- **Core logic** — getAvg, getVerdict, getUptime, filterByTier, sortResults, findBestModel
- **CLI arg parsing** — all flags (--best, --fiable, --opencode, --openclaw, --tier)
- **Package sanity** — package.json fields, bin entry exists, shebang, ESM imports

## Changelog

After every dev session (feature, fix, refactor), add a succinct entry to `CHANGELOG.md`:

- Use the current version from `package.json`
- Add under the matching version header (or create a new one if the version was bumped)
- List changes under `### Added`, `### Fixed`, or `### Changed` as appropriate
- Keep entries short — one line per change is enough
